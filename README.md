# AI Training Data

Welcome to the AI Training Data repository! This project aims to be the largest public collection of AI training data, supporting a wide range of applications and research in artificial intelligence. By consolidating data into a single repository, we hope to make AI research and development more accessible and efficient.

## Contributing

We invite contributions from anyone interested in advancing AI research. To contribute, please add your data to the appropriate language-specific file following these guidelines:

1. **Identify the correct file** for your dataset based on the programming language of the data or its intended use case. Each language has a single file named `code.language` (e.g., `code.js` for JavaScript).
2. **Edit the file** by adding your dataset. Ensure to append your contribution in a manner that maintains the organization and readability of the file. Include comments or sections as necessary to distinguish your dataset.
3. **Submit a pull request** with your changes. In your pull request, provide a brief description of your dataset and explain how it can benefit AI research or applications.

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub or prefer not to use Git, you can also contribute by opening an issue. In the issue, describe your dataset and how it can be integrated into the existing file, and a maintainer will assist you.

## File Structure

This repository simplifies access to AI training data by organizing it into language-specific files. Each programming language is represented by a single file, named using the convention `code.language`. This approach ensures easy navigation and contribution:

- `code.js` for JavaScript datasets
- `code.py` for Python datasets
- `code.java` for Java datasets

## Dataset Submission Guidelines

Before submitting your dataset, please ensure it meets the following criteria:

- **Licensing**: Your dataset must be freely available for public use. Include licensing information within your dataset contribution.
- **Documentation**: Provide a brief description of your dataset within the file, including its source, structure, and potential applications.

## License
